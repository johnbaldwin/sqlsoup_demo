RESTnotes: RESTful web notebook
===============================

RESTnotes is an Apache2 Licensed web notebook, written in Python, using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

The goal of RESTnotes is to have a very simple but robust web notebook with authentication and authorization baked in, rather than bolted on to the application.
